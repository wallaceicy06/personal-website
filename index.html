                    <p>I grew up in sunny southern California in a seaside town
                    called Manhattan Beach. I spent much of my early life
                    becoming a Lego master builder, going to the beach in the
                    summers, and making amateur films with my friends. I went
                    to Loyola High School in downtown Los Angeles. I discovered
                    in high school that I had a passion for the arts, which
                    manifested through my involvement in the Hannon Theatre 
                    Company. During this time, I also realized my talent for
                    software after taking AP Computer Science. Fusion of art
                    and technology is a large motivator for me, and a driving
                    force that influences my life direction.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-4 bio">
                    <p>My college experience was ultimately defined by travel.
                    I began at Northeastern University and soon transferred to
                    Rice University. I lived in Boston, Houston, Austin, and
                    Pittsburgh before setting currently in San Francisco. I am 
                    currently a software engineer at Google, working in the San 
                    Francisco office. I consider myself a software generalist,
                    always excited to learn new skills and technologies. If I
                    had to call out specializations, I have experience with
                    full-stack web development, as well as networks and
                    distributed systems. In my free time, I like spending time
                    outdoors whether it is hiking, biking, or skiing. I am
                    pursuing obtaining my private pilot license.</p>

                                <p>Number Munchers is a children's game aimed
                                to teach basic math skills. It is a replica of
                                the original version developed by MECC in the
                                1980s. Players control a green monster, "Number
                                Muncher", and eat numbers on a game board
                                according to a specified constraint. These
                                constraints range in difficulty, and cover
                                factors, multiples, and primes. Players avoid
                                other monsters on the board that can eat them,
                                and can use the safety squares (indicated by
                                white corner borders) to stay away from the
                                other monsters.</p>

                                <p>The project was developed as a part of my AP
                                Computer Science curriculum in January 2011.  I
                                had no prior experience with graphics or
                                multi-threading prior to this project. The
                                project makes high use of Java Swing and AWT
                                libraries to draw the GUI. There is minor
                                inclusion of timed threads to coordinate each
                                monster's moves independently. Another new
                                concept that I learned was handling input
                                interrupts by implementing key events to
                                control the Muncher character.</p>

                            <p>Networked Scrabble is an implementation of the
                            popular board game intended for multi-player use
                            over a local area network. Each user connects to a
                            game server (which need not be a separate computer)
                            by entering the server's IP address in the client
                            prompt. After players have connected, the server
                            distributes tiles and dictates which player has the
                            ability to make a move. After a user confirms with
                            their move, the server verifies that their tiles'
                            placement does not have a word inconsistency, and
                            then passes control on to the next player. The
                            score is reported to each user accordingly.</p>
                            <p>The game is in a workable state but to this day
                            is not considered complete in the sense that it is
                            impossible to "win" and several features of the
                            game are missing. The focus of this project was
                            more internal than external. It was a joint project
                            between myself and Chris Miles developed after our
                            AP Computer Science Class in 2011. We wanted to
                            explore networking as it related to computer
                            applications, and felt a multiplayer game would be
                            a good way to do that.</p> <p>During the process,
                            we encountered numerous challenges relating to
                            object serialization and recovery, synchronization,
                            and efficient data lookup. We were very fortunate
                            to solve each of these problems which had not been
                            encountered in previous work. To send requests over
                            the network, we developed move request and move
                            confirmation objects that are sent from the client
                            to the server and from the server to all clients,
                            respectively. These are sent over the network and
                            decoded and displayed appropriately by each client.
                            A move confirmation is sent to each player after a
                            move to solve the synchronization problem. For
                            quick word lookup, we used a hash table to quickly
                            determine whether all words on the board were
                            valid.</p>

                            <p>MASS (Metro Analytics Software System) is an
                            interactive software tool to ease the analysis of
                            transit data. Using simple data collected from
                            automated passenger counters on buses and trains, a
                            user can import and view this data on a map
                            interface. Using the tools, the user can then
                            select, view, and manipulate data to draw
                            conclusions that are not immediately obvious from
                            looking at the raw data or plotting it on a graph.
                            Using the comparative analysis tools, one can
                            select multiple transit lines at once to see how
                            different data metrics (like boardings) compare
                            across the lines. The tool was developed
                            specifically for the planning department of the Los
                            Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
                            Authority.</p> <p>MASS was my first experience with
                            a project geared towards software engineering.
                            Previous projects had dealt with one window at
                            most, which made handling of user input and
                            commands relatively simple. With a program with
                            several windows, options, data, and views, it took
                            a lot of research and planning to design the
                            program so that it would function properly. The map
                            uses a highly customized version of the JMapViewer
                            toolkit in order to display the transit lines on
                            top of a street map of the region. The program made
                            high use of keyboard and mouse input in order to
                            manipulate the objects on the display. The project
                            on Github is the project in its form when I
                            submitted it to Metro. It is currently being
                            developed on further internally and used for data
                            analysis and schedule adjustment.</p>

                            <p>I became involved with the Catholic Student
                            Association at Rice University during my first year
                            there, and it was clear from the start that our
                            marketing to students needed some improvement. This
                            included better advertising around campus, but also
                            online through social media and our official
                            website. I volunteered to take on the project of
                            re-writing the website from scratch to provide a
                            simple, informational gateway to all that our
                            organization is about.</p> <p>This was the first
                            official website I had worked on, and opted to use
                            the open source Joomla CMS to handle content
                            management. Since the majority of people editing
                            content are not familiar with PHP or HTML, I wanted
                            to provide a system that was accessible to
                            everyone. I started from a basic template and
                            modified several of the PHP, HTML, and CSS files to
                            provide a unique website. In addition, I set up a
                            custom email server using Roundcube that is hosted
                            on our personal server.</p>

                            <p>I had always wanted to make a music-synced
                            Christmas light system. Over Thanksgiving Break
                            while I was staying at Rice, I spent some of the
                            extra days breadboarding basic LED circuits to be
                            controlled by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Using
                            an open-source MIDI synthesizer, I was able to turn
                            lights on and off according to a six note scale.
                            Once I was confident that the system worked using
                            small LEDs, I bought some solid state relays and
                            hacked a shoebox together with all the necessary
                            components to place in the tree and display a light
                            show. During the show, I controlled the music via
                            an SSH connection to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

                            game that I played at the Google Pittsburgh office,
                            <i>Betrayal at the House on the Hill</i>.  It is a
                            mini-RPG where you and your friends are trapped in
                            a haunted house. After a period of time playing,
                            one of your friends betrays you and it is up to you
                            to escape the house before the traitor kills you!

                            Lauren Staal. We used many open source web
